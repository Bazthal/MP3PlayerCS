# MP3PlayerCS (Legacy Version)

This is the original version of my MP3Player project, written in C# over 10 years ago using **BASS.NET** and **WinForms**.

> This code is messy, unoptimized, and very old. It is preserved here for historical and reference purposes only.

## Status
- No longer maintained
- Not intended for reuse
- Available for reference and archival

## Legacy Screenshot

## This project originally depended on:
- `bass.dll` – [BASS audio library](https://www.un4seen.com/)
- `Bass.Net.dll` – .NET wrapper for BASS
- These are not included due to licensing restrictions. so this project will not compile without these

## Successor
The project has been completely rebuilt from scratch as **[MP3PlayerV2](https://github.com/BazthalLib/MP3PlayerV2)** with:
- A new audio engine (CSCore)
- Custom UI library
- WebSocket remote control
- Now Playing broadcaster for StreamerBot
